// This mixin applies focus-visible styling, taking Safari in consideration where focus-visible doesn't work
// Instead, we apply styles to the focus state first, which solves the purpose, but unwantedly also for the active state
// We fix this for non-Safari browsers afterwards by resetting to default and then re-applying using focus-visible
